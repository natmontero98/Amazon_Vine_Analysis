* There were  170 Vine reviews and 37840 non-Vine reviews. There is a substantial difference beetween both amounts, given that around 99% of the reviews were from     the non paid Vine program. 

* For the Vine reviews, 65 were 5 stars, and for the non Vine reviews, 20,612 were 5 stars. 

* In the paid Vine program, 5 star reviews represented a 38.2% of the total. 
  For the unpaid Vine, 5 star reviews represented a 54.5% of the total. 

## Summary
According to the results seen for the pet-products reviews, it doesn't look like there's a positive bias for reviews in the Vine program. This program actually presented a lower percentage of 5 star reviews than the unpaid program (38% vs. 54%, respectively).

An additional analysis that could be done with the dataset, is to get the percentages for 4 star reviews, given that this is also considered a "positive" review. Analysing both ratings (4 and 5 stars), together and separately, might give us a better insight into possible biases. 

It would also be interesting to research if there might actually be a bias for negative reviews in the paid program, because that's were the tendency seems to be at first sight.
